# ðŸ§¬ Cervical Cancer Cell Detection and Segmentation

A deep learning approach for cervical cell classification and segmentation using CNNs, U-Net, and Detectron2 on the SpikMed dataset.

## ðŸ“– Abstract

Cervical cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide. Early and accurate detection of abnormal cervical cells plays a crucial role in effective diagnosis and treatment.

This project presents a deep learningâ€“based pipeline for cervical cell classification, segmentation, and instance detection, integrating multiple architectures â€” Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification, U-Net for semantic segmentation, and Detectron2 for instance segmentation of overlapping cells. All models were trained and evaluated on the SpikMed dataset, which contains high-resolution microscopic cervical cell images.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

The project comprises three core modules designed to work sequentially:

### 1. Cervical Cell Classification (CNN)

A custom CNN was trained to classify cervical cells into normal and abnormal categories. The network utilized convolutional and pooling layers to extract discriminative features from high-resolution images.

**Key Steps:**

- Input preprocessing and normalization
- Training with cross-entropy loss
- Evaluation using accuracy and F1-score metrics

### 2. Semantic Segmentation (U-Net)

To achieve precise cell boundary detection, a U-Net architecture was implemented. The model effectively segmented individual cells from complex background regions, leveraging skip connections to preserve spatial details.

**Highlights:**

- Encoderâ€“decoder structure based on ResNet backbone
- Data augmentation using Albumentations
- Dice coefficient and IoU metrics for evaluation

### 3. Instance Segmentation (Detectron2)

For overlapping cell scenarios, Detectron2â€™s Mask R-CNN was applied. It enabled detection and separation of multiple cell instances within a single image, improving the accuracy of segmentation under real-world conditions.

**Configuration:**

- Pretrained COCO weights for initialization
- Fine-tuned using custom SpikMed annotations
- Threshold-based filtering for high-confidence masks
